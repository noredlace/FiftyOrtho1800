In an attempt to learn how to design a PCB I chose to design an ortho layout that I decided I really liked. Instead of going for a standard 4 row x 14 col layout, I opted for trying to optimize the pins. This was done to allow for ws218b LEDs to be utilized for underglow. Thus this layout uses an 8 row x 7 col design. This leaves 3 extra pins to be utilized, with one of the three being for ws218b. Of course this comes with the consequence of not being neat to trace especially on top of this being the first design I have worked on.
