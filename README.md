# 5018OOrtho
A design by u/lizardsticks a.k.a [chkstong yibbibi](https://chkstongyibbibi117162601.wordpress.com/)

A fifty Ortho based off of the arrow cluster gaps from the 1800 layout. <br /> 
Name is a serious WIP. The name is just like what I thought of in my head when thinking of the design. an Ortho with the arrow key Gap, and just so happened to be ~50ish"

In an attempt to learn how to design a PCB I chose to design an ortho layout that I decided I really liked. Instead of going for a standard 4 row x 14 col layout, I opted for trying to optimize the pins. <br />
This was done to allow for ws218b LEDs to be utilized for underglow. Thus this layout uses an 8 row x 7 col design. This leaves 3 extra pins to be utilized, with one of the three being for ws218b.

Of course this comes with the consequence of not having beautiful tracing lines especially with this being my first design. <br />

**Note: The PCB above is outdated. I had used an incorrect footprint of the ProMicro that resulted in the right side pins being upside down while the left side pins were correct. This has been fixed.
